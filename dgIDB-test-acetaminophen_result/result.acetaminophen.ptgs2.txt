PMA/Ionomycin in SK-N-SH cells by targeting IKKβ phosphorylation and activation.	PMID:	25460026	
2	Cause	Tlp-2	Theme	NFAT	relation	induced	relation_class	Positive_regulation	sentence	. AM404 also inhibited NF-κB activation induced by
PMA/Ionomycin in SK-N-SH cells by targeting IKKβ phosphorylation and activation.	PMID:	25460026	
3	Cause	Cav-1	Theme	Caveolin-1	relation	regulate	relation_class	Regulation	sentence	.edu

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a membrane scaffolding protein, which functions to regulate
intracellular compartmentalization of various signaling molecules.	PMID:	20100502	
4	Cause	COX-3	Theme	COX-1	relation	variant	relation_class	Positive_regulation	sentence	. However, COX-3 was found to be a spliced variant of COX-1 and renamed
COX-1b.	PMID:	17627114	
5	Cause	endogenous bradykinin	Theme	THR	relation	mediated	relation_class	Positive_regulation	sentence	. Summing up, in
our in vivo bioassay system ACE-Is such as quinapril, perindopril or captopril at
non-hypotensive doses evoke THR that is mediated by endogenous bradykinin and
prostacyclin derived from endothelial COX-2.	PMID:	15626595	
6	Cause	IL-6	Theme	STAT3	relation	induced	relation_class	Positive_regulation	sentence	. In the same cell type neither IL-1beta-dependent
SAPK activation nor IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation is affected by the drug.	PMID:	14664905	
7	Cause	IL-1beta	Theme	NF-kappaB	relation	dependent	relation_class	Positive_regulation	sentence	.
These data indicate that therapeutic concentrations of acetaminophen induce an
inhibition of IL-1beta-dependent NF-kappaB nuclear translocation.	PMID:	14664905	
8	Cause	Interleukin 1beta	Theme	prostaglandin E synthase	relation	induces	relation_class	Positive_regulation	sentence	.

Interleukin 1beta induces functional prostaglandin E synthase in cultured human
umbilical vein endothelial cells.	PMID:	12512699	
9	Cause	NIM	Theme	ACETA	relation	effect	relation_class	Regulation	sentence	. In contrast, IND
increased, whereas both NIM and CECOX did not have any effect on ACETA action in 
writhing test.	PMID:	11990080	
10	Cause	COX	Theme	COX	relation	involvement	relation_class	Regulation	sentence	. The possible involvement of COX and NO synthase systems in
antinociceptive activity of ACETA is discussed.	PMID:	11990080	
11	Cause	COX	Theme	NO synthase	relation	involvement	relation_class	Regulation	sentence	. The possible involvement of COX and NO synthase systems in
antinociceptive activity of ACETA is discussed.	PMID:	11990080	
12	Cause	COX-2 inhibitors	Theme	COX-1	relation	effects	relation_class	Regulation	sentence	. However, the microsomal assay was
more sensitive to inhibition than cell-based assays and allowed the detection of 
inhibitory effects on COX-1 for all NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors
examined with discrimination of their potency under conditions of limited
availability of arachidonic acid.	PMID:	9365818
